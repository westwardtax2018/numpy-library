# Were you able to generate a correct plot?
#  If no, what was the your biggest obstacle?
#  If yes, what was the biggest challenge you overcame?
A1="""
[please answer in the docstrings provided]
I was not able to generate a plot as there was a problem with the ray itself when I was attempting to run the file. 
"""

# In your own words, describe what information
# you think the simulation (based on what you
# see in the plots) provides to you.  (If you
# don't have your own plots, use those in the
# assignment PDF.)
A2="""
The plots show us the behavior of light within the LSC and helps us to understand more about the ray paths. 
It also tells us how frequent the light is interacting with different surfaces. 
"""

# Choose any one geometric variable in this analysis
# (e.g., length, height, solar angle, etc.) to change
# and write your prediction for how varying it will
# vary the efficiency and why you thing so.  Then test
# your hypothesis by running the simulation with your
# perturbed value and describe the effect on the
# results that you observe.
A3="""
The solar angle affects the efficiency of the system. Reducing the angle could enchance the efficiency while decreasing it could reduce the efficiency. 

"""

# From your own experience, how might coursework
# in Chemistry or Materials Science add knowledge
# to make this simulation more accurate?
A4="""
Coursework or general knowledge in chemistry could potentially make this simulation more accurate because we have knowledge of refractive indexes and the Lenz law. 
"""

# Is there anything else you want us to know about
# your work on this homework project (good or bad)?
A5="""
The assignment was good, but it was very long and any number of issues would create problems elsewhere in the files within this assignment.
